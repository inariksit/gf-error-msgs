  1) Check that you are not trying to pattern match a /runtime string/.
     These are illegal:
       lin Test foo = case foo.s of {
                         "str" => â€¦ } ;   <- explicit matching argument of a lin
       lin Test foo = opThatMatches foo   <- calling an oper that pattern matches

  2) Not about pattern matching? Submit a bug report and we update the error message.
